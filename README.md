# ASER: A Large-scale Eventuality Knowledge Graph

ASER (activities, states, events, and their relations), a large-scale eventuality knowledge graph extracted from more than 11-billion-token unstructured textual data. ASER contains 15 relation types belonging to five categories (Temporal, Contingency, Comparison, Expansion, and Co-Occurrence), 194-million unique eventualities, and 64-million unique edges among them.

Some APIs are provided, please check the Jupyter Notebook [ASER.ipynb](ASER.ipynb).
