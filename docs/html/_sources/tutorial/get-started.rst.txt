Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently we only support setup from source. So the first step download this repo

.. highlight:: bash
.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/ASER.git

Then install ASER requirements

.. highlight:: bash
.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Finally install ASER as a python package

.. highlight:: bash
.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py install

To run ASER extraction, you need to download corenlp 3.9.2 (2018-10-05) from https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/download.html.

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python

    import urllib
    import zipfile
    import shutil

    urllib.request.urlretrieve("http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-corenlp-full-2018-10-05.zip", "stanford-corenlp-3.9.2.zip")
    with zipfile.ZipFile("stanford-corenlp-3.9.2.zip", "r") as zip_ref:
        zip_ref.extractall("./")
    shutil.move("stanford-corenlp-full-2018-10-05", "stanford-corenlp-3.9.2")

To run ASER conceptualizatoin, you need to download Probase from https://concept.research.microsoft.com/Home/Download.

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python

    import urllib
    import zipfile
    import shutil

    urllib.request.urlretrieve("https://concept.research.microsoft.com/Home/StartDownload", "probase.zip")
    with zipfile.ZipFile("probase.zip", "r") as zip_ref:
        zip_ref.extractall("./")
    shutil.move("data-concept/data-concept-instance-relations.txt", "probase.txt")
    shutil.rmtree("data-concept")

Local Pipeline: aser-pipe
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before getting started, We write three reviews from yelp into a file and want to run the pipepline to build KG.db and concept.db.

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python

    import os

    os.mkdir("raw")
    os.mkdir("processed")
    os.mkdir("core")
    os.mkdir("full")
    os.mkdir("concept")

    with open("raw/yelp.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write("I went there based on reviews on yelp. I was not let down! I got the wild mushroom personal pie and added spinach and fresh jalapenos on the ancient grains crust. It was amazing. The crust was perfectly cooked and all the toppings meshed well together. They have many vegan options(daiya cheese). The owner and the other employee there were very nice and friendly. I will definitely be going back next time I am in town.")
        f.write("\n\n")
        f.write("My experience at this kneaders location was great! I wasn't there during a busy time, about 3:45, but they were very attentive. I placed my to go order and it was ready within 10 minutes. I will definitely be back!")
        f.write("\n\n")
        f.write("I came here for breakfast before a conference, I was excited to try some local breakfast places. I think the highlight of my breakfast was the freshly squeezed orange juice: it was very sweet, natural, and definitely the champion of the day. I ordered the local fresh eggs on ciabatta with the house made sausage. I would have given a four if the bread had been toasted, but it wasnt. The sausage had good flavor, but I would have liked a little salt on my eggs. All in all a good breakfast. If I am back in town I would try the pastries, they looked and smelled amazing.")
        f.write("\n\n")

Then, we can start aser-pipe from command line.

.. highlight:: bash
.. code-block:: bash

    $ aser-pipe -n_extractors 1 -n_workers 1 \
        -corenlp_path "stanford-corenlp-3.9.2" -base_corenlp_port 9000 \
        -raw_dir "raw" -processed_dir "processed" \
        -core_kg_dir "core" -full_kg_dir "full" \
        -eventuality_frequency_threshold 0 -relation_weight_threshold 0 \
        -concept_kg_dir "concept" -concept_method probase -probase_path "probase.txt" \
        -eventuality_threshold_to_conceptualize 0 -concept_weight_threshold 0 -concept_topk 5 \
        -log_path "core/aser_pipe.log"

Now, you can check the core, full, and concept directories.

Step-by-step extraction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's see how to utilize an ASER extractor and a conceptualizer.
We provide two kinds of ASERExtractors: the SeedRuleASERExtractor corresponding to the WWW"2020 and a new DiscourseASERExtractor which is implemented based on a discourse parsing system.

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python

    from pprint import pprint
    from aser.extract.aser_extractor import SeedRuleASERExtractor, DiscourseASERExtractor

    text = "I came here for breakfast before a conference, I was excited to try some local breakfast places. I think the highlight of my breakfast was the freshly squeezed orange juice: it was very sweet, natural, and definitely the champion of the day. I ordered the local fresh eggs on ciabatta with the house made sausage. I would have given a four if the bread had been toasted, but it wasnt. The sausage had good flavor, but I would have liked a little salt on my eggs. All in all a good breakfast. If I am back in town I would try the pastries, they looked and smelled amazing."
    print("Text:")
    print(text)

    aser_extractor = DiscourseASERExtractor(
      corenlp_path="stanford-corenlp-3.9.2", corenlp_port=9000
    )

    print("-" * 80)
    print("In-Order, Use-Lemma:")
    pprint(aser_extractor.extract_from_text(text, in_order=True, use_lemma=True))

    print("-" * 80)
    print("Out-of-Order, Use-Lemma:")
    results = aser_extractor.extract_from_text(text, in_order=False, use_lemma=True)
    pprint(results)

    print("-" * 80)
    print("In-Order, Use-Token:")
    pprint(aser_extractor.extract_from_text(text, in_order=True, use_lemma=False))

    print("-" * 80)
    print("Out-of-Order, Use-Token:")
    results = aser_extractor.extract_from_text(text, in_order=False, use_lemma=False)
    pprint(results)

    eventualities, relations = results

If succeed, you can see the following outputs:

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python

    Text:

As shown above, the in-order will keep the sentence order and token order so that it is a nested list. On the contrary, the out-of-order will return a set of eventualities and a set of relations.

Then, we use the conceptualizer based on probase to conceptualize eventualities.

From the conceptualization results, we can find each eventuality would result in multiple concepts. You can use these to make your eventuality representation meaningful.

we do not show build_concept_relations because it requires the concept database. If you are interested, you can use build_concept_relations(aser.database.kg_connection.ASERConceptConnection, List[aser.relation.Relations]).

Do not forget to close your database connections to make the databases available for other processes.

Client/Server Mode
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can start aser server from command line

.. highlight:: bash
.. code-block:: bash

    $ aser-server -n_workers 1 -n_concurrent_back_socks 10 \
        -port 8000 -port_out 8001 \
        -corenlp_path "stanford-corenlp-3.9.2" -base_corenlp_port 9000 \
        -aser_kg_dir "core" -concept_kg_dir "concept" -probase_path "probase.txt"

Please wait patiently until  `"Loading Server Finished in xx s"` shows up in your console

Now you can access ASER by `ASERClient` from your python code

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python

    from aser.client import ASERClient
    client = ASERClient(port=8000, port_out=8001)

And you can extract the eventualities

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python

    text = "I came here for breakfast before a conference, I was excited to try some local breakfast places. I think the highlight of my breakfast was the freshly squeezed orange juice: it was very sweet, natural, and definitely the champion of the day. I ordered the local fresh eggs on ciabatta with the house made sausage. I would have given a four if the bread had been toasted, but it wasnt. The sausage had good flavor, but I would have liked a little salt on my eggs. All in all a good breakfast. If I am back in town I would try the pastries, they looked and smelled amazing."

    print(client.extract_eventualities(text).__repr__())

It will finally give you this output:

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python

    [[],
     [i think, it be very sweet],
     [i order, the local fresh egg on ciabatta make sausage],
     [i would have give a four, the bread have be toast],
     [the sausage have good flavor, i would have like a little salt on egg],
     [],
     [i be back in town, i would try the pastry, they look, they smell amazing]]

Let's try the relation extraction:

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python

    e1 = client.extract_eventualities("The sausage had good flavor.")[0][0]
    e2 = client.extract_eventualities("I would have liked a little salt on my eggs.")[0][0]

    print(e1.__repr__())
    print(e2.__repr__())
    print(client.predict_eventuality_relation(e1, e2)

And the output should look like the following:

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python

    the sausage have good flavor
    i would have like a little salt on egg
    (253e8b127b833c3aa7d79e2b91ce030299a646d6, 8dd8fbc06d2810add7b2cfd637a78f90fa2e5e9e, {'Contrast': 1.0, 'Co_Occurrence': 1.0})

And we can retrieve the KG to see what eventualities are connected to `e1` (the sausage have good flavor):

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python

    print(client.fetch_related_eventualities(e1))

We get the same relation:

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python

    [(i would have like a little salt on egg,
      (253e8b127b833c3aa7d79e2b91ce030299a646d6, 8dd8fbc06d2810add7b2cfd637a78f90fa2e5e9e, {'Contrast': 1.0, 'Co_Occurrence': 1.0}))]

Conceptualization is powerful to aggregate eventuality information and relations, we can also use the server to do conceptualizatoin and retrieval.

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python

    c1 = client.conceptualize_eventuality(e1)[0][0]
    c2 = client.conceptualize_eventuality(e2)[0][0]

    print(c1.__repr__())
    print(c2.__repr__())
    print(client.predict_concept_relation(c1, c2))

And we can find the *contrast* relation between c1 (meat have flavor) and c2 (__PERSON__0 like inorganic-contaminant):

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python

    meat have flavor
    __PERSON__0 like inorganic-contaminant
    (5a49d855f23b29d0a769d638a0944c0d35815ca9, 86e7181b3e449dd70dd9bd0eebcca5b73b432a8c, {'Contrast': 0.02687880595658219, 'Co_Occurrence': 0.02687880595658219})

Similarly, we can retrieve the concept KG to fetch all neighbors of c1:

.. highlight:: python
